# Multipurpose Online Coding Assessment Platform (MOCAP): Improving Coding and Marking Experience

> [!NOTE]
> This project will be open-sourced in May, 2024.

## Background
At the start of each course, computer science students need to set up a coding environment on their local machines. It poses challenges for students due to discrepancies in libraries, dependencies, operating systems, and hardware. These differences can lead to problems when running assignments in markers' environments, resulting in disputes between students and professors. To address this issue, we propose the Multipurpose Online Coding Assessment Platform (MOCAP), a centralized web platform aimed at simplifying the setup of coding environments and ensuring replicability and consistency with markers' environments.

## Deliverables
MOCAP offers a pre-configured coding environment accessible through the web platform, eliminating the need for individual local machine configurations. MOCAP includes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with features such as code completion and syntax highlighting, enhancing the coding experience and productivity. MOCAP also offers customized test cases for students to validate their code against the professorâ€™s code to ensure code accuracy. In addition, MOCAP offers a question bank feature where past exercises can be stored. This resource provides students with a convenient way to access and practice previous assignments, helping them prepare for midterms and finals.
