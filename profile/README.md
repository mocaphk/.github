# Multipurpose Online Coding Assessment Platform (MOCAP): Improving Coding and Marking Experience

At the beginning of each course, students are required to spend a considerable amount of time setting up the coding environment on their local machines. Additionally, students need to upload their files to hand-in assignment, and professors need to download the files and run on their machines. Sometimes, students’ program may success in students’ environment but fails in teacher’s environment. This might cause more dispute and time waste.

Our project aims to solve these problems by creating a web-based platform. By doing so, we hope that it could be an all-in-one platform that can be used to facilitate better and easier learning process for students.
